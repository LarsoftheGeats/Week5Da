    "Easy to Understand, at a glance you can tell categories, and see what is what.  Good contrasts for different plots on the same graph, good labeling, avoid giving a distorted picture to the viewer.\n",

    "Tells a Story, your data shows something happening that's important for the viewer to understand, so for instance a line plot of sales per quarter would highlight a sharp dip and include a % change as a sidebar for the viewer.

    "## 2 Basic Principles of Visual Perception\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order\n",
    "The order in which items are preceived, in text this follows standard practices, but in viewing graphs it can be random and sporadic, so each element of the graph needs to be comprehensible on its own to help a viewer flow from first viewing to complete understanding.  Also in general people don't remember every item they see, only the first 2 or 3 items, so trying to draw the eye to the important information through color choice helps your message last longer in the mind.  \n",
    "### Hierarchy\n",
    "The eye tends to be drawn towards brighter colors, so you can highlight specific items in such a way that every element fits into part of a story, for instance adding a vertical line in a graph draws the attention to each side of the graph, so pay attention to how the line attracts attention, and make sure it fits in with the context of the story you want your data to   tell. \n",
    "### Clarity \n",
    "If there's a part of the data you want to emphasize use design elements to bring attention to it.  Like highlighting, or text on the graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships\n",
    "Humans tend to tell stories that relate things which are together on a graph.  We like to form patterns and do so naturally.  Presenting data together on a graph will naturally lead viewers to connect them in their heads, don't present false relationships.\n",
    "### Convention\n",
    "We have some  expectations on graph layout, and color palette, for instance we'd expect similar items to have similar colors on a legend.  This groups things in our mind.  Also some graphs are useful for conveying time information, but poor for conveying % information or bin-like informtion.  Violating those expectations can lead to mis-understanding, or rejecting the conclusions of the graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these items can be used to highlight the important data you want to convey, and help you avoid conveying things you don't want to convey.  \n"

    "These are  both good tools  because they show the size of a rectangle as a proportion of a bigger rectangle, letting you form comparisons in your mind more easily.  And our visual system is pretty good about making that comparison naturally, so complex relationships can be conveyed sparsely.  But my default is a bar chart, I generally prefer a pie chart to treemap, but familiarity might have bred contempt in everyone when it comes to bar charts.  "
